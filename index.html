                              <p>For businesses, the culmination of 2022 and the start of 2023 was a period marked by exciting opportunities and immense challenges. While a global economic downturn has tested businesses’ resiliency, advancements in the field of AI have presented a revolutionary way for organizations to advance and become more efficient. Meanwhile, as social media platforms continue to evolve, businesses are transforming their strategies to prioritize newly profitable channels. Specifically, short-form videos on Youtube have emerged as a popular channel for brand content and influencer marketing. Online businesses have similarly had to reasses their strategies for drawing in customers, many of whom have become more price-conscious amid rising prices and economic uncertainty. </p><br>
                         </b>
                         
                         <b>
                              <p>These trends emerged at the core of Fiverr’s latest analysis of trending searches on the platform. Based on search data over a period of six months, the top three trends among businesses globally are: (1) Businesses are increasingly aware of the performance value of short-form video content, specifically on YouTube, (2) there is growing interest in leveraging generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Midjourney, and (3) e-commerce operators are looking to strategically elevate their business to compete in an economic downturn, leading to demand for Etsy and Shopify related services. </p><br>
                         </b>
                         <b>
                              <p>Based on these findings, it’s clear business leaders are eager to pivot their organizations and are looking to the latest platforms, technologies, and talent to elevate their businesses. They’re also looking to freelance experts who can help them integrate new technologies, such as AI, develop short-form video content, and adjust their online marketing strategy. For freelancers, this means these skills are in high demand, creating new opportunities for independent workers who are familiar with platforms like Midjourney and ChatGPT, or who have a video-editing or consulting experience. As businesses strive to innovate and remain competitive in turbulent times, these experts play a critical role in helping organizations keep up with the latest trends and technology.</p>
